What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
A computer scientist doesn't just create a program. They utilize algorithms to create faster and more efficient results for various problems. Artificial Intelligence is the highest topic of discussion. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I use facts logic and craftiness to create new solutions to new problems. A machine can not create as a human does as most films personify. Math sequences and comparing data are how the best results are found.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My responsibilities are to not weaponize information or cause harm to any user. Morals and values must be kept as a spiritual man like myself must maintain that sanctity.
